      <p>Normally, Azura has auburn brown hair, olive skin and forest green eyes.
        However, the day she opened her eyes for the first time her eyes glowed
        a brilliant blue, marking her as one of the chosen of the unknown goddess
        which her people worshipped.</p>
      <p>Originally, she was raised in a small village in a dense forest, nestled
        near the mountains. There, she was taught about the unknown goddess, was
        taught about the ways of the village, and learned about the workings of
        nature from a druid who dwelt in the woods outside of her home town.
        However, one day her eyes glowed azure once more, causing her to receive
        a vision of the village’s destruction. She tried to warn the townsfolk,
        but they dismissed it as being dreamt up. Besides, they preferred to
        trust in their small village’s sturdy walls, guards, and gates to protect
        them. Their downfall proved to be a spy already inside the village, who
        then poisoned the guard’s food and opened the gates. That very night a
        posse of marauders entered the village and started slaughtering everyone
        in it. Since Azura is relatively small for a human and had learned a fair
        bit about stealth from observing the creatures of the wild she was able
        to escape, unlike the rest of her people. However, because of this event
        she has a fair amount of skepticism toward the perceived infallibility of
        civilization and a lack of trust towards those she doesn’t know.</p>
      <p>After that Azura wandered the land, never staying in one place too long
        and learning much from the world around her. She continues receives
        visions from the goddess she was blessed by. Before long she became
        comfortable surviving on her own, and quickly became friends with the
        wild beast and learned to control the environment with magic. Although
        she never directly interacts with other people if she can help it, much
        preferring the creatures she has befriended, she was still able to learn
        about the workings and languages of the elves, gnomes, and unfamiliar
        humans by observing them from afar. She wears owl feathers in her hair
        and keeps an iron symbol of the unknown goddess of her village as her
        only reminders of her past. Other than learning new spells, exploring,
        and conversing with the native fauna, her only hobby is to play her
        flute when there is time to spare.</p>
      <p>This hobby lead to her first direct contact with someone she has never
        met before. One night while Azura was playing her flute in a beautiful,
        somber melody, a drow elf heard her song and came venturing near out of
        curiosity. Naturally cautious, Azura was quick to flee from the interloper,
        but the elf was able to keep up with her. After scrambling up a tree and
        asking what the elf wanted, she discovered that the elf was truly
        oblivious to the ways of the upper world, having lived underneath the
        mountains nearby all her life. Settling down on the tree branch, Azura
        was able to explain to the elf what she knows of the light lands, and
        despite initial misgivings, were able to become to an understanding and
        become friends. Still, the elf, Ivory, had to return to the under lands
        where she came from, so Azura watched her go, saddened to have to say
        goodbye to her elven companion but glad that she could help teach and
        guide her (especially since she actually listened).</p>
      <p>Azura eventually met the elf again after several years living as an
        outlander and progressing in her skills to the point where she made a
        passable druid herself. They have traveled together ever since.</p>
