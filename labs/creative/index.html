      <p>So, I feel there is some explanation that is needed here. You see, this
        website came into being by the inspiration gained by the phenomenon known
        as a club within a club. For various reasons, involving exercise and self
        defence, starting the first semester of my freshman year I joined the
        Shotokai Karate Club and made definate progress with it. We have a pretty
        tight nit group, the ages which range from freshman to just about to
        graduate from graduate school. Lots of pain, goofiness and jokes abound.
        In fact, seemingly on a whim our group has essentially developed a club
        within a club, which we have just recently started in earnest.</p>
      <p>Within our club we have lots of gaming fans, ranging from DnD to Pokemon.
        Usually this manifests in the form of tons of references and quips, along
        with playing Smash together at our Socials. However, this semester some
        members of our club decided they wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons, and
        that evolved to enclude basically all of the active members of Shotokai
        Karate currently operating within BYU. In other words, we essentially have
        a DnD Club within our Karate Club, which is comprised of almost all the
        members of said Shotokai Club.</p>
      <p>Initially I was not sure if I was going to join, since I have 3 CS classes,
        an OCI, along with Anthropology and Religion. 17 credit hours is a bit
        much, if last semester has taught me anything. Still, it sounded fun, not
        to mention a welcome reprieve from constant meetings and coding, so I decided
        to play DnD with the rest of the party. I have never played DnD before in
        my life, so it is bound to be interesting.</p>
      <p>I actually have only set up my character thus far, so that is what I
        used as the basis for this website. It amuses me that there is an image
        online that just happens to look almost exactly like the character I made.</p>
